(ns kotoba.crdt.clock-kotoba-parity-test
  "Binds `clock.kotoba` to `clock.cljc` — the same questions, the same answers.

  ## What was already checked, and what was not

  `kotoba-conformance-test` compiles all four modules and asserts each one's
  conformance `main` returns 42. That proves the modules link and execute,
  which is worth having and is not this. It says nothing about whether the
  Kotoba clock and the Clojure clock agree, because nothing ever ran them over
  the same inputs.

  They are two implementations of one rule — Lamport receive (`max(local,
  received) + 1`) and a total order with the actor id as tiebreak — and until
  now only one of them could be wrong at a time without anything noticing.

  ## Why the clock first

  Every other primitive here uses a clock stamp as its merge tiebreak, so
  `before?` is what makes `register` and `orset` converge. A disagreement here
  is a disagreement everywhere, and it is the cheapest one to check.

  ## Scope, stated rather than implied

  Actors are `:i64` on the Kotoba side, and the `.cljc` accepts any comparable
  id, so the cases use integer actors — the overlap, not the whole `.cljc`
  surface. `stamp`, `after?` and `max-stamp` have no Kotoba counterpart and are
  not covered here; that is a gap in the port, not in this test."
