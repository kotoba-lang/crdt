  library. What it writes IS what a consumer loads, so nothing here transforms
  it: pretty-printed EDN, no post-processing. The drift test calls
  `compile-kir` rather than repeating the compile call, because a test that
  compiled differently from this file would be checking something other than
  what ships."
