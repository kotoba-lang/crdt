(ns kotoba.crdt.orset-kotoba-parity-test
  "Binds `orset.kotoba` to `orset.cljc` — the same adds, the same survivors.

  The property that matters here is not `add` or `remove` in isolation; it is
  that a remove tombstones only the tags it has actually observed, so an add
  concurrent with a remove survives it. Two editors depend on that: one deletes
  a shape while the other adds one, and neither loses their edit.

  Both files implement that rule, one over Clojure maps and sets and one over
  typed guest maps with explicit index recursion. Nothing had ever run them
  over the same operations.

  ## How this is driven

  Operations are data, applied to both implementations by the same interpreter
  below, and the only thing compared is membership — `contains-elem?` on the
  guest, `elements` on the `.cljc`. Internal state is never decoded: a replica
  is whatever its own implementation says it is, and the question asked of both
  is the only one a caller can ask.

  `observed-tags` is chained guest-side (its result feeds `remove-tags`) rather
  than reconstructed host-side, so a disagreement about which tags a replica
  has observed shows up as a disagreement about membership.

  ## Scope, stated rather than implied

  Elements are `:i64` and tags are clock stamps, which is the guest's type and
  a subset of what the `.cljc` accepts. `elements` has no guest counterpart —
  only `contains-elem?` — so set-at-once equality is checked by asking about
  every element the script mentions."
