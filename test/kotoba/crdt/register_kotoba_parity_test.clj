(ns kotoba.crdt.register-kotoba-parity-test
  "Binds `register.kotoba` to `register.cljc` — the same writes, the same winner.

  `clock-kotoba-parity-test` closed the primitive every other CRDT here leans
  on. This closes the first thing built on it. Until now the two register
  implementations had never been run over the same inputs: `kotoba-conformance-test`
  proves the module links and its `main` returns 42, which says nothing about
  whether the Kotoba register and the Clojure register pick the same winner.

  The rule is last-write-wins under `clock/before?`, with the register that was
  passed in decided by the stamp and not by which side of the merge it arrived
  on. Both files say that; only one of them could be wrong at a time.

  ## Scope, stated rather than implied

  Values are `:string` on the guest side; the `.cljc` accepts anything. `init`
  is covered through `merge-register` rather than directly — the guest returns
  a `none` option and the `.cljc` returns `nil`, and the interesting question
  is whether the two absences behave alike in a merge, not whether they print
  alike."
