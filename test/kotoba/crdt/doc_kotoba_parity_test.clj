(ns kotoba.crdt.doc-kotoba-parity-test
  "Binds `doc.kotoba` to `doc.cljc` — the same op log, the same document.

  This is where the other three meet: entity membership comes from the OR-Set,
  field values from the LWW-Register, and both are reached through one op type.
  Agreeing on `orset` and `register` separately does not imply agreeing here,
  because `doc` is where each one is wired to the other — `apply-set` merges an
  incoming register into whatever the entity already had, and `merge-docs`
  merges field maps entity by entity.

  ## How this is driven

  Ops are data, applied to both implementations by the same interpreter below.
  Only what a caller can observe is compared: entity membership and field
  values. Internal state is never decoded.

  A `:remove` op carries the tags it tombstones explicitly rather than reading
  them out of a replica — `orset/observed-tags` is not exported from `doc`'s
  root, and a script that says which tags a remove had seen reads better than
  one that depends on when it ran.

  ## Scope, stated rather than implied

  Entities are `:i64`, fields `:keyword`, values `:string` — the guest's types,
  a subset of the `.cljc` surface. The `.cljc` helpers that mint ops and drive
  a clock (`add-entity`, `remove-entity`, `set-field`, `receive`, `snapshot`)
  have no guest counterpart; `apply-op` and `merge-docs` are the shared surface
  and are what this covers. `.cljc` has no `contains-entity?`, so membership is
  asked as `(contains? (doc/entities d) e)`."
