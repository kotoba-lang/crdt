  "Shared plumbing for the `.kotoba` <-> `.cljc` parity namespaces.

  Not a test namespace on purpose — the runner picks up `*-test`, and three
  suites compiling the same four modules separately is the only thing this
  exists to avoid.

  ## Why the types are written out rather than read back

  Every type here is spelled exactly as the `.kotoba` module declares it. If a
  record or variant changes shape, these stop matching and the calls fail,
  instead of silently following the change — the same choice
  `clock-kotoba-parity-test` made and for the same reason.

  ## Host encoding of guest values, as the KIR interpreter returns them

      record      [record-type field ...]
      option      [option-type false]  |  [option-type true payload]
      typed map   [map-type [[k v] ...]]
      hetero vec  [vector-type element ...]
      variant     [variant-type :case payload]

  Measured, not assumed: each of these was executed against the interpreter
  before being written down."
