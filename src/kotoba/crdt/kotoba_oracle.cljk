(ns kotoba.crdt.kotoba-oracle
  "Runs the shipped decision cores.

  `src/kotoba/crdt/*.kotoba` holds the decisions;
  `resources/kotoba/crdt/oracle/*.kir.edn` is what was compiled from them and
  what ships. This namespace is the seam, and it is deliberately thin: it
  resolves a resource, executes an export, and decides nothing.

  ## Why this exists

  `clock.kotoba` landed with `clock-kotoba-parity-test`, which ran both
  implementations over the same inputs and required the same answers. That was
  the right first step and it is still here. But two implementations bound by a
  test are still two implementations, and the measure of the port is not how
  many host lines went away; it is whether the AUTHORITY moved. Until now it had
  not: the `.kotoba` was a checked replica and the `.cljc` was what ran. Now the
  `.kotoba` is what runs for the inputs it can express, and the `.cljc` keeps
  the halves that are not decisions — reading a map, naming a key, choosing a
  path.

  ## The guest ABI, and the two places the host has to meet it

  `kir/execute` takes a record as `[schema field …]` in DECLARED field order and
  returns the same shape, so `record` is a positional constructor and nothing
  more. The declared order is not written down here: `signature` reads it back
  out of the shipped artifact, which IS the `.kotoba` compiled, so callers get
  the order from the source of the rule rather than from a host copy of it.

  `:i64` is a JVM `long` under `:clj` and a `js/BigInt` under `:cljs`, and
  neither is what a `kotoba.crdt` host map holds. `i64` and `i64-value` are that
  conversion, kept here so a host never has to know which runtime it is on.

  ## No fallback around a missing artifact

  A missing or unreadable artifact throws. It does not quietly run something
  else, because a silent fallback is how a decision stops being the one that
  shipped.

  ## ClojureScript hosts must register the KIR

  There is no classpath to read a resource from, so `register-kir!` is the only
  way in and `kir` throws without it. That is a real narrowing of what this
  library used to do on that runtime and it is stated rather than discovered:
  see the boundary note on `kotoba.crdt.clock`."

;; ── the two modules that are not here ────────────────────────────────
;;
;; `orset.kotoba` and `doc.kotoba` are compiled, linked and bound to their

;; They cannot be: both hold a collection whose size is the user's document,
;; and the interpreter refuses an ADT value past a node limit. Measured against
;; the pinned interpreter, with one add-tag per element:
;;
;;   orset   10 elements cross;      11 raise `ADT value exceeds node limit`
;;   orset   14 tags on one element cross; 15 raise it
;;   doc      4 entities cross;       5 raise it
;;
;; A document with five shapes in it is not an edge case, so there is no
;; version of this seam that puts `merge-orset` or `merge-docs` behind the
;; shipped artifact. That is a property of those cores — an OR-Set merge IS a
;; whole-collection operation — and not a shortfall in the port, so they keep
;; their parity gates and nothing pretends otherwise.
;;
;; `register` is the opposite shape and that is why it is here: `merge-register`
;; is handed exactly two registers no matter how large the document grows, so
;; one decision's worth of data is a constant. `doc.cljc` reaches it per field,
;; which is how a document whose STATE cannot cross still has its per-field
;; winner decided by the shipped core.
